# A BASH script makes the first command line argument available as $1, the second as $2 and so on.
# The command run, exactly as it was called but without the command line arguments, is stored in $0.
#
# The dirname command returns the directory name part of a filename.
# Note that the directory and/or file do not actually exists; dirname simply strips the last component of a file path.
# For example, "dirname /a/b/c" will echo "/a/b", "dirname ../a/b/c" will echo "../a/b", "dirname ../" will echo "." and so on.
#
# The directory the BASH script is located in can be retrieved using "dirname $0"
#
# Note although the cd command is used, the script will not change directory and any other calls within it are still relative to the current working directory.
#
# This is useful when you need to reference a file that sits next to the script.
cd $(dirname "$0")

# Read in from fileName and store in varName
IFS=$'\n' read -d '' -r -a varName < ./fileName

# Loop through items in varName
for i in "${varName[@]}"; do
  echo "processing ${i}"

 printf "\n\n\n"
